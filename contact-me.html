            This is a joke website created by me, Ipaikmos. I took my friend Sikong's website and completely overhauled it with a superficial knowledge in html. Most of the content was written by GPT, but all of the code was written by me and Sikong. But the images are messed up lol and I couldn't figure out how to like, fix them.
            <br><br>
            Anyways, you can check me out at <a href="ipaik.com" class="ab">ipaik.com</a> (WIP)
            <br>
            I also use komkaipi as my discord. You can message me there.
            <br>
            Props to Sikong for letting me destroy his website. You can find him here: <a href="https://zengsikong.github.io/index.html" class="ab">ZengSikong</a>
